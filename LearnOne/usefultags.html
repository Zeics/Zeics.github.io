                <p>In programming language theory, semantics is the field concerned with the rigorous 
                    mathematical study of the meaning of programming languages.[1] It does so by evaluating
                     the meaning of syntactically valid strings defined by a specific programming language, 
                     showing the computation involved. In such a case that the evaluation would be of 
                     syntactically invalid strings, the result would be non-computation. Semantics describes
                      the processes a computer follows when executing a program in that specific language. 
                      This can be shown by describing the relationship between the input and output of a program,
                       or an explanation of how the program will be executed on a certain platform, hence creating
                        a model of computation.
